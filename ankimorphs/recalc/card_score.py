#                                      ALGORITHM
####################################################################################
# The algorithm is calculated with the following equation
#
#     score = (
#             unknown_morphs_total_priority_score
#             + all_morphs_avg_priority_score
#             + all_morphs_total_priority_score
#             + leaning_morphs_target_difference_score
#             + all_morphs_target_difference_score
#     )
#
# Each of the terms has an associated weight that can be used to bias
# the term arbitrarily, e.g.:
#
#     unknown_morphs_total_priority_score = (
#             TOTAL_PRIORITY_UNKNOWN_MORPHS_WEIGHT * total_priority_unknown_morphs
#     )
#
# A lower total score means that the card will show up sooner
# in the new card list, so each of the factors can be thought
# of as a penalty.
#
# Priority is measured by frequency of the morph. An unknown morph
# that has a higher frequency will have a lower priority score
#
# TERMS IN THE ALGORITHM:
#
# - unknown_morphs_total_priority_score:
#   The sum of the priority scores for all the unknown morphs.
#   Note: We only implement a "total priority" version since cards should ideally
#   only contain one unknown morph.
#
# - all_morphs_avg_priority_score:
#   The average (mean) of the priority scores for all found morphs.
#
# - all_morphs_total_priority_score:
#   The total priority scores for all found morphs
#
# - leaning_morphs_target_difference_score:
#   The penalty given when the target number of learning morphs is not reached.
#   This is used as a means of reinforcing new vocabulary.
#   A piecewise quadratic equation is used for more flexibility, i.e. the punishment
#   can be higher for overshooting the target vs undershooting, and vice-versa.
#
# - all_morphs_target_difference_score:
#   Same as "leaning_morphs_target_difference_score", but for all morphs.
