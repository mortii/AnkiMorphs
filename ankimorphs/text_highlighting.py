    # To highlight morphs based on their learning status, we wrap them in html span elements.
    # The problem with this approach is that injecting html between morphs can break the functionality
    # of ruby characters (https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/fields.html#ruby-characters).
    #
    # To prevent that problem, we have to first have to iterate over the string and extract the ruby characters
    # and return the filtered string. Next, we can run almost the same procedure with the found morphs: extract
    # them and filter the string. Once both of these passes are completed, we are left with a string that
    # only has non-word characters and text that did not match any morphs.
    #
    # Take, for example, the following (contrived) text:
    #   "Hello[ハロー] myy world!"
    #
    # The process would look like this:
    # 1. The "[ハロー]" part is found to be ruby characters and is therefore removed from the
    # string and stored in a dict along with its original position, leaving us with string:
    #   "Hello myy world!"
    #
    # 2. The words "Hello" and "world" are found to be morphs, and information about them and their original position
    # are stored as SpanElement objects in a list, and are then removed from the string and replaced
    # by whitespaces, leaving us with:
    #   "      myy      !"
    #
    # 3. We now have all the information we need to reassemble the string with the span elements that contain the morphs
    # and any ruby characters that directly followed them will be included in the spans.
    #
    # The final highlighted string could end up looking something like this:
    #   "<span morph-status="known">Hello[ハロー]</span> myy <span morph-status="unknown">world</span>!"
