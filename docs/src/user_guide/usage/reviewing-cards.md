# Reviewing Cards

### Starting Out

When you first start using MorphMan you will probably come across many variations of Interjections (e.g. "Aaah!", "
umm...", "Wow!") and other uninteresting
words. [Just tag them as known](reviewing-cards.md#encountering-morphs-you-already-know)
and move on. When you reach a critical mass of known morphs, usually around 50-100, is when you will start encountering
useful sentences.

Stuttered names or words might accidentally produce morphs that don't make any sense in the context, and you should
probably just suspend these cards or mark them as known if there are many of them.

MorphMan might seem error-prone at first, like mixing up two (seemingly) different morphs, but the more data it
accumulates the more accurate it becomes, so try not to get discouraged! It becomes much more enjoyable to use the after
you know a couple hundred morphs.

It is a good idea to frequently [Recalc](recalc.md) when you are first starting out, maybe every 10 cards or so,
to make sure you get the best possible new cards.

### Encountering Morphs You Already Know

If you already know the morphs in a card you are presented then use the hotkey “K” (for Known) to add the “Already
known” tag to the card and skip it.

Next time you run [Recalc](recalc.md), MorphMan will add all the morphs contained in the card to your mature database.

### Encountering Cards You Don't Understand

There will also be times when MorphMan says a card is [1T](../glossary.md#1t-sentence), but you aren’t able to
understand it. There are two reasons this may occur. The first is that, due to incorrect parsing, MorphMan thinks you
know a word that you don’t. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to remove a Morph from MorphMan’s database. Luckily,
this really shouldn’t happen very often. When it does, your only real option is to suspend or delete the card.

The other scenario is that you aren’t able to understand a sentence deemed 1T despite it indeed
containing only one unknown morph. This is simply a fact of life when it comes to language learning. Sometimes you know
all the words in a sentence, but still just can’t get what it means. It could be due to many things, such as one of the
words having an alternate meaning you haven’t learned yet, or the grammar being too tricky for you parse at your current
level. Basically, although the sentence appears to be 1T, it’s actually [MT](../glossary.md#mt-sentence). By definition,
any sentence that’s truly 1T
shouldn’t be difficult to understand.

Whenever this happens its best to either [find a better card](reviewing-cards.md#finding-a-better-card) or suspend/delete the
card and move on. The whole point of MorphMan
is to help you make fast progress by collecting low hanging fruit. If you spend time mulling over things that are above
your level, you’re defeating the purpose of the add-on.

### Finding A Better Card

If you want to learn a different card instead of the one you are presented then press the hotkey
“L” to open the browser and see all the other [1T](../glossary.md#1t-sentence) cards in your collection with the same
focus morph. If you want to see all 1T _and_ [MT](../glossary.md#mt-sentence) cards you can use "Shift+L".

From here you can right-click your preferred card and select "Learn Card Now". You can also find the same options in
the "MorphMan" menu at the top.

The card will then go to the top of the "new cards"-queue, if you have other due cards then they might show up first.
