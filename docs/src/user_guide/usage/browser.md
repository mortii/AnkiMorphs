MorphMan adds new options in the Browse window that can be accessed either from the "MorphMan" menu at the top or when
right-clicking cards:

* **View Morphemes**:  
  Opens a pop-up window showing the Morphs of the cards' [specified field](../setup/preferences/note-filter.md#fields).
* **Learn Card Now**:  
  Raises selected cards to the top of the "new cards"-queue.
* **Browse Same Morphs**:  
  Searches for all the cards that have the same [focus morph](../setup/preferences/extra-fields.md) as the selected card.
* **Tag As Known**:  
  Adds the “Already known” tag to the selected cards.
