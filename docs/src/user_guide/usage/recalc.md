Recalc is short for “recalculate”, and is basically the command that tells MorphMan to work all its
magic. When you run Recalc, MorphMan will go through
the [cards that matches any 'Note Filter'](../setup/preferences/note-filter.md) and do the following:

* Update the MorphMan [databases](../glossary.md#database-db) with any new seen morphs, known morphs, etc.
* Reorder your cards based on their [MorphMan Index](../glossary.md#morphman-index-mmi).
* Update each card's [focus morph](../setup/preferences/extra-fields.md) and [tags](../setup/preferences/tags.md).

Basically, when you run Recalc, MorphMan will go through your collection, recalculate
the difficulty of your cards based on your new knowledge, and reorder your new cards in a way that’s optimal for the new
you: the you who knows more than you did yesterday.

You can run Recalc as often as you like, but you should run it at least once before or after every study session so that your
new cards will appear in the optimal order.
