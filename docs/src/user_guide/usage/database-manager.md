# Database Manager

The MorphMan Database Manager is a tool for manipulating [database files](../glossary.md#databases). Its most important
feature is creating database
files out of text files. For example, let’s say you have a Japanese novel formatted as a text file. You could input this
text file into the Database Manager, and have it output a database file with all the Morphs contained in the novel.

If you named this database file “external.db“, and placed it in the [database folder](../glossary.md#databases), once you
Recalc, MorphMan will add all of those Morphs to your mature.db database. If you do a lot of learning
outside of MorphMan, this is a good way to catch MorphMan’s database up to your current knowledge.
