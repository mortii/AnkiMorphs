# Parsing Dictionary

In order to keep track of what you know, MorphMan uses a parsing dictionary to divide up sentences into
individual [morphs](../glossary.md#morph).

MorphMan comes pre-packaged with parsing dictionaries for some languages, but for Japanese the user must install one
separately in order for MorphMan to function.

> **Note**: parsing dictionaries are only for parsing and canâ€™t be used to obtain definitions for words.

## Japanese Parsing Dictionary

The most advanced Japanese parsing dictionary currently available for MorphMan is the "MeCab UniDic" dictionary. Once
it is installed, simply restart Anki and MorphMan will automatically start using MeCab UniDic for parsing.
