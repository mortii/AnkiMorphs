# Extra Fields

![extra_fields.png](../../../img/extra-fields.png)

When MorphMan goes through your card it finds the unknown morphs and then places them in a dedicated field
on your card to make lookups much easier later on. Those unknown morphs will be the learning focus of the card, hence the name "focus morph(s)".

[Adding a focus morph field to your cards](extra-fields.md#adding-a-focus-morph-field-to-your-cards) is the most
complicated part of the setup process in my opinion, but when you are done with that you are very close to being ready to
use MorphMan!

The other seven fields are purely for debugging purposes, just leave them empty.

MorphMan will update the contents of these fields after each [Recalc](../../usage/recalc.md).

5. Name it whatever you want, I chose "focus_morph". This is the name that you will need to place in the "Extra Fields" tab in MorphMan preferences.
