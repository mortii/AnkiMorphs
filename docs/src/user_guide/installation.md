# Installation

You can download the latest version of MorphMan from [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/900801631). If you have
old hardware that can only run old versions of Anki then you can find previous versions of
MorphMan [here](https://github.com/kaegi/MorphMan/tags).

If you are want to use Morphman with Japanese you have
to [install a dictionary parser](installation/parsing-dictionary.md).

After the installation is complete some [Setup](setup.md) is required to get Morphman to work. After that you can
run [Recalc](usage/recalc.md) and you will be good to go!


[Here is an overview](installation/changes-to-anki.md) of the changes that are made to Anki after installing MorphMan.
