# Extra Fields (Dev)

MorphMan has the ability to auto-fill up to 8 different fields with specific information about your cards. This will only apply to cards specified in the “Note Filter” tab. In the “Extra Fields” tab, you can customize the names of each of these seven fields. In order for MorphMan to auto-fill the fields, you have to add each corresponding field to your note-types.

The  Fields are as follows:

1. Focus Morph: The unknown Morph in sentences with one unmature Morph. Cleared once all Morphs are mature. If a card is not 1T, this field will be left blank.
2. Unmatures: Comma-separated list of unmature Morphs.
3. Unknowns: Comma-separated list of unknown Morphs.
4. Unknown Frequency: Average of how many times the unknown Morphs appear in the specified portion of your collection.
5. MorphMan Index: [MMI](../user_guide/glossary.md#morphman-index-mmi)
6. Unmatures Count: Number of unmature Morphs on this note.
7. Unknown Count: Number of unknown Morphs on this note. 
8. Focus morph POS: POS means part-of-speech.
