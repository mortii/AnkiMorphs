MorphMan is an Anki addon that tracks what words you know, and utilizes that information to optimally reorder language cards. This
**greatly** optimizes your learning queue, as you will only see sentences with exactly one unknown word (see
[i+1 principle](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/morphman/#glossary) for a more detailed explanation).

Install MorphMan via [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/900801631)

MorphMan supports the following languages:

- languages with spaces: **English**, **Russian**, **Spanish**, **Korean**, **Hindi**, **etc.**
- **Japanese**: You must additionally install the _[Japanese Support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684)_ Anki addon
- **Chinese**: For Anki 2.0, please use [Jieba-Morph](https://github.com/NinKenDo64/Jieba-Morph). Chinese is included in Morphman for Anki 2.1
- **CJK Characters**: Morphemizer that splits sentence into characters and filters for Chinese-Japanese-Korean logographic/idiographic characters.
- more languages can be added on request if morpheme-splitting-tools are available for it
